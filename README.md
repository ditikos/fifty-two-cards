# Fifty Two Cards
## an introduction to card games

Hi, I am making this as a card game introduction. I've been using javascript mostly for UI/UX purposes, so I decided to use it differently.
I am also into _typescript_ a language that recompiles into **javascript** but with a better type handling.


## How to build
At the moment, the only thing that it does is shuffle using Fisher-Yates algorithm the 52 normal cards.
To build, it requires:
- node.js
- npm
- typescript (`npm -g install typescript`)
- typings (`npm -g install typings`)

Clone and then do:
- [x] npm install
- [x] typings install
- [x] npm start

There are no optimizations at this point, this software is as is.
