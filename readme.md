# Fifty Two Cards
## an introduction to card games

Hi, I am making this as a card game introduction. I've been using javascript mostly for UI/UX purposes, so I decided to use it differently.
I am also into _typescript_ a language that recompiles into **javascript** but with a better type handling.
